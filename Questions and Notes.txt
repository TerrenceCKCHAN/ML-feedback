How does the shader lab framework connect to shader programs and how does it run them

WebGL vs OpenGL

Web GL can do immediate feedback, state machine translating outputs




In c make gui
cmake list
configure, select vscode version
Put in path, build directory, 


build on rel with dev info -> compile


possible errors, ammended shaderlab framework, intensities, position light sources (For phong shading), colours, not too much on default parameters
combination of errors, add contraints, cnn latent representation
