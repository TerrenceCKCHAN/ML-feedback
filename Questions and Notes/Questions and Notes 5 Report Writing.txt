\section{Method}
overview 
- graphics 
i.e. projections and phong model
(formalise) - > \Omega

- -> 
ML approach (image analysis method and
NLP approach -> 
text feedback 

- 
System architecture




tables with classification performance
scores f1 etc.


MLP CNN SVM etc.. naive baseline
scores
computational requirements
Can run on any virtual machine etc.
variance
highest bold




NLP qualitative - examples
interface, screenshots

Methods:
Assumptions -camera fix etc.
no description of framework
explanations of equations

Evaluations
LImitations, discuss the research or neutraly present the research
descibe data and evaluate.
Discussion all limitations: 
tables, discuss the result - computation efficiency of classification vs multilabel classification
data cannot be big
nlp 
limitations of the framework - no tensorboard

future work immediate work, claim anything

conclusion
summary of what I did
