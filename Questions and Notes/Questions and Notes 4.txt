TODO:
Resolve tfjs node module installation -- YES
save model -- YES
// First Experiment on model mlp -> improve model fluctuation

*Create better data / build CNN network

**Depending on where you want the test data to be -> 
Restructure the architecture: separate folder for test data -> data conversion etc.
*Perform testing on final network

*generate statistics from model -- Research
*HParams for hyper-parameters tuning

NEXT:
1. Extend the network to more classes of error and provide flags
2. General API for Teacher
3. Student be able to use it: UI

Convolutional neural network





Histogram of all the pixels
image representation + intensity representation
=> convolution network 
lack of spacial recognition -> for each type of flaw

cross validation 
randomized data
