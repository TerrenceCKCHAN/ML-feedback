TODO:
ML accuracy, performance
normalize data before fitting



neuraltalk - possibly an overkill
Validation set Test set - softmax argmax -> predicted class -> store in a list
skr learn -> recall... performance
Check every few epochs to see how they perform
F1...

Very static feedback for now - list the errors and vanish upon refinement




1. Rework ML training model -> split dataset into three sets
2. Better Data
if accuracy > 90
then 1st experiment done.
3. More classes and training data - possibly a more complicated neural network
4. Extend the task to more tasks such as texture mapping ... etc
5. Create training data interface for teachers
6. Create interface for students to input glsl shaders
