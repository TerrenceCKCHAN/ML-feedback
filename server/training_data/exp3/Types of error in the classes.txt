Class 0: correct phong
Class 1: n dot l: n is not normalized
Class 2: no specular
Class 3: no diffuse
Class 4: n dot l: l is not normalized
Class 5: reflect(-l, n) becomes reflect(l, n)
Class 6: normalize(-vertexPosition): Not normalized
Class 7: Switch n dot l and r dot v
Class 8: Switch ambient and specular term
Extended:
Class 9: no shininess - ie rDotv power 1
Class 10: nDotL -> rDotL, rDotv -> nDotv

Class x: no ambient
