Class 1 and Class 3:
n dot l: n not normlized and no diffuse

Class 4 and Class 5:
n dot l: l is not normalized
AND
reflect(-l, n) becomes reflect(l, n)

Class 3, 4, 5:
no diffuse,
n dot l: l is not normalized
reflect(-l, n) becomes reflect(l,n)

Class 3,4,5,9
no diffuse,
n dot l: l is not normalized
reflect(-l, n) becomes reflect(l,n)
no ambient

Class 1-10
n is not normalized
nDotL -> rDotL, rDotv -> nDotv

Class 6-10
normalize(-vertexPosition): Not normalized
nDotL -> rDotL, rDotv -> nDotv

Class 2-6-10
no specular + 6-10

Class 3-10
no diffuse + mix up ndotl,rdotv

Class 1-3-10
no normalize n + 3-10

Class 5-10
reflect -l to l
mix up ndotl,rdotv

Class 1-5-10
no nomalize n + 5-10
