VertexShader and FragmentShader are the skeleton of the working phong shading model

vertexShader and fragmentShader 0 are used to generate the ground truth for the phong shading model:
Alternating colour and controlled variation of light positions. 
Note that the random function is not entirely random but determined by the input seed

vertexShader and fragmentShader 1 are in class 1 -> 
normalInterpolation(n) is not normalized before calculation of n dot l

vertexShader and fragmentShader 2 are in class 2 ->
No specular component

vertexShader and fragmentShader 3 are in class 3 ->
No diffuse component


#Extend
No Ambient,
wrong diffuse (n dot l)
wrong specular (r dot v)
light in shadow
wrong perspective (Maybe)
